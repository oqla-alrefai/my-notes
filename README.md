üëã Hi, I‚Äôm **Oqla Alrefai** I'm *28* years old
üå± I‚Äôm currently Working as a Software Engineer 

## mindset
-  key points that every developer must master:
1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software.
`What is bad software? A complex system that doesn‚Äôt help people that much`.
2. The Goals of Software Design
`Every programmer is a designer`
- the most important goal of the software design:
To design systems that can be created and maintained as easily as possible by their developers, so that they can be‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand continue to be‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääas helpful as possible .
- there are two key points here: Your design should be **easy** for you and **helpful** for others.
3. (Mis)understanding
- the best ways to improve your design skills is to be sure that you fully understand the systems and tools you are working with.
4. Simplicity
5. Complexity: the jop of the programmer is to control their software complexity so they don't fall to the endless days of fixing bugs.

6. Maintenance: one of the main responsibilities of the developer is maintaining their software.

7. Consistency: keep the formate of your code on your software consistent don't change it in every file.

8. Prioritizing: your decisions must follow some rules and they should be in this equation

D(The desirability of a change)

V(The value of a change)

E(The effort required to perform the change)

D = V/E

the higher the value the better the change will be to your software.

9. Solving Problems: there is 3 steps to solve problems

- understanding.
- planning.
- dividing.

10. Good enough is fine: what are the problem chasing perfection do to your projects?

You will be writing code that isn‚Äôt needed
You will increase complexity by adding unnecessary codes
You will be too generic
You will be missing deadlines
You will be dealing with many bugs caused by the complexity
the way to avoid it is to Start small, improve it, then extend you system.
11. Predictions: developing generic software will increase the the complexity of you code and you may develop some unneeded code.
12. Assumptions: Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.
13. Stop Reinventing: stop reinventing tools when you have one exists. the only time you can reinvent is:
- You need something that doesn‚Äôt exist yet
- All of the existing ‚Äúwheels‚Äù are bad technologies or incapable of handling your needs
- The existing ‚Äúwheels‚Äù aren‚Äôt being properly maintained
14. Resistance: you should stop thinking about adding more code to your software.
15. Automation: don't waste your time on something that can be automated.

16. Code measurement: don't measure the quality of the code by the number of lines more lines mean more complexity and you should avoid having less code.

17. Productivity: the productivity is measured by how many lines of code you write but how many lines of code you remove.

18. Testing: before you make any changes to the project file you should test your code.

19. UnderEstimation: don't underestimate the time and effort to make a software or you will be missing a lot of deadlines.

20. Running Away From Rewriting: you should stay away for rewriting your code.

21. Documentation and Commenting: commenting should explain why you did something instead of what your code is doing.
documenting helps new developer who joined your team to understand the software as a whole.

22. Picking Technologies: Don‚Äôt depend on external technologies. But when you have to do so, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can.

23. Self-Development: keep learning and Know that every specific problem has its own specific solution.

24. Don‚Äôt be a hero: Don‚Äôt be obsessive, Know when to quit and Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask for help.

25. Don‚Äôt Ask Questions‚Ä¶ Ask For Help:when you face a problem don't ask for help immediately, instead try anything and everything you can think of didn't find a solution, search! Find answers and try them out then understand why they work, adapt them to your code. But always seek advice from your senior.
